title: DMFT in a nutshell
subtitle: Dynamical mean-field theory is a sophisticated tool from statistical physics that has been developed in the context of spin glasses. It is however also useful in a variety of other cases. In this post, we will step through the main notions of mathematical machinery to see how this procedure goes. 

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Systems that undergo a noisy environment show fluctuating behavior. The assumption that those perturbations are finite allows the prediction of the typical state of the system. Surprisingly, our expectations change qualitatively if we allow for fluctuations of finite size.
