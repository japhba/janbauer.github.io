\begin_layout Standard
Is random behavior helpful in any situation? By definition, random actions
 are the most uninformed, and if any better is known should be suboptimal.
 Yet, the issue is more subtle.
 Reinforcement learning and game theory can be paradigms to reason about
 this.

Reinforcement learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reinforcement learning is a framework to identify the appropriate actions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{t}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of an agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 in an environment 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}$
\end_inset

 that will maximize an expected reward 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle\mathcal{R}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} ,\mathcal{E}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)\right)\rangle_{\mathcal{E},t}$
\end_inset

 over time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and possible environments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that in general, the actions affect the environment; 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

 and hence the reward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an endgame in soccer.
 The captain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is deciding whether to aim to the left or the right of the goal.
 What should the captain do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's say the goalkeeper has a weak left side and will never go there.
 Then, the captain should always score left and will always hit the goal,
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}^{\star}=L$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's say the goalkeeper has a not quite so weak left side and will go there
 40% of the time.
 Should the captain then aim right 40% of the time to cover the cases where
 the goalkeeper might go left? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a fallacy known as probability matching that human behavior has
 been shown to be susceptible to.
 If we calculate the expected reward however, we see a difference:

\begin{array}{ccccccc}
\langle R\rangle & = & 0 & \cdot & p(\text{aim }L) & \cdot & p(\text{jump }L)\\
 & + & 1 & \cdot & p(\text{aim }L) & \cdot & p(\text{jump }R)\\
 & + & 1 & \cdot & p(\text{aim }R) & \cdot & p(\text{aim }L)\\

 & + & 0 & \cdot & .4 & \cdot & .6\\
 & = & 0 & + & .12 & +.12 & +0\\
 & = & 0.52.
\end{array}
\]

\begin_inset Formula $p(\text{aim }\text{L})=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reveals that probability matching is actually not the right strategy!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Incorporating time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This result is surprising! Note that we made a critical assumption: There
 is only a single trial, and captain and goalkeeper part and never meet
 again after.
 Let's say we have a clever goalkeeper who learns that when the captain
 shoots left, he will have a preference to do so afterwards (ignoring his
 weak leg).
 In that setting, the 'goalkeeper'-environment 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}$
\end_inset

 now changes its response to actions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

.
 What is the optimal strategy now?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The captain now is in bad luck: Whenever he develops a preference, the goalkeepe
r will adapt to it in the very next trial.
 If he held on to this strategy, he would never score a goal again! So should
 he just alternate the sides he targets? The goalkeeper could counteract
 this with likewise just changing sides.
 In fact, any more complicated schedule will eventually be learned by a
 sufficiently clever goalkeeper and hence only give a temporary advantage.
 Even more, throwing a dice every ten shoots will not change this in principle.
 The best we can do here is to either come up with an insanely complicated
 schedule that decides when to shoot left or right (a 
\emph on
pseudorandom
\emph default
 schedule).
 This, as the name suggests, is then practically indistinguishable from
 a completely random schedule: The captain throws a dice every time and
 minimizes the mutual information of his policy and the action 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\star}=\text{argmin}_{\pi}\mathbb{I}\left[a_{t},a_{t+1}\right],$
\end_inset

 where we now understand 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\pi\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

 as a distribution over sequences of actions 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a varying strategy can be better than being purely exploitative! Note
 that we are variable, but not random, as we are actually using our knowledge
 about the clever gatekeeper â€“ a model of the world 
\begin_inset Formula $p(s_{t+1}|a_{t},s_{t})$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
A stubborn goalkeeper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is soccer then boring in the end? Again, our modelling was too simple:
 What happens when the goalkeeper takes some time to adapt to a change in
 strategy of the captain, let's say on a timescale 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

? A rationale for that could be a stubborn goalkeeper: Even though the captain
 now aimed 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 four times, this surely was just out of random, and I should continue to
 respond at random! (a prior belief about the strategy of the captain).
 The captain might then have an advantage: He on expectation can get 2 more
 goals in after that point, because the goalkeeper will continue to behave
 randomly.
 So, indeed, it can be a game of psychology between the two: When the goalkeeper
 adheres to his beliefs, the captain might be able to leverage an advantage
 and exploit for a couple of trials before adapting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Exploration vs.
 exploitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can try to formalize this towards a general case.
 First, we are discussing the case of complete knowledge of the world model,
 and then discuss the case where the world model is insufficiently known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Knowledge of the exact world model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the exact transition structure of the world is known (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}=p$
\end_inset

), the optimal action can be calculated as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{t}(s_{t},p^{(t)})=\text{argmax}_{a_{t}}\:\mathbb{E}_{p^{(t)}}\left[R_{t:}\,|\,a_{t},s_{t}\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that evaluating this exactly is typically intractable because of the
 exponentially growing branches of possible futures.
 It might now be the case that the argmax is not unique, i.e.
 two actions yield the same reward.
 In this case, choosing between at random is equally rewarding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Incomplete knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case of complete (though statistical) knowledge of the world transition
 structure (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}\neq p$
\end_inset

) is what prevents a discussion of exploration, as everything is already
 known.
 Here, we now relax this assumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we only have an incomplete model of the world, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}^{(t)}(s_{t+1}|a_{t},s_{t})$
\end_inset

, and suppose that we can acquire observations 
\begin_inset Formula $o_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 through specific actions 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 that help refine it towards the actual 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 So what we should really write then is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{t}(s_{t},\hat{p}^{(t)},\hat{\mathcal{P}}^{(t)})=\text{argmax}_{a_{t}}\:\mathbb{E}_{\hat{\mathcal{P}}^{(t)},\hat{p}^{(t)}}\left[R_{t:}|\Delta D^{KL}|_{SS}\bigl[\hat{p}^{(t+1)}||p\bigr](a_{t}),a_{t},s_{t}\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta D^{KL}|_{SS}\bigl[\hat{p}^{(t+1)}||p\bigr](a_{t})$
\end_inset

 is a meta-world model that maps actions to information gain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta D^{KL}|_{SS}$
\end_inset

 restricted to the sufficient statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $SS$
\end_inset

 of under the believed informativeness 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathcal{P}}\left(\Delta D^{KL}|_{SS}\,|\,a_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the world through the sampling action 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 It can well be that a certain observation convinces the agent of the poorness
 of its world model â€“ for example that no rewards keeps coming in, even
 though their actions are the same.
 The meta-world model now predicts higher reward under an action that will
 explore, as the agent 
\emph on
believes it to increase
\emph default
 the information about the world, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta D^{KL}|_{SS}(\hat{p}^{(t+1)}||p)\,|\,a_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 If several actions now produce the same 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{t:}$
\end_inset

-pertinent information gain, they can be chosen randomly.
 From the outside, this may appear to be random exploration, whereas it
 actually is exploration that is informed by the agent's belief about pertinent
 information gain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, we arrive what might be called a fully Bayesian way of acting:
 At every point in time, the agent uses its approximate world model 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}^{(t)}$
\end_inset

 as well as an (approximate) model 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathcal{P}}^{(t)}$
\end_inset

 about the information gain to choose the most rational action.
 If an exploratory action is not expected to increase pertinent information,
 then the agent 
\emph on
exploits 
\emph default
according to the case of exact knowledge 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}=p$
\end_inset

, otherwise it 
\emph on
explores.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying this once again to soccer, it means that it might be optimal to
 aim for the left side from time to time, if our belief 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$
\end_inset

 about the world suggests that this will help us in determining whether
 for example the goal keeper has changed their policy.
 Conversely, if we are confident that the goalkeeper does never change his
 strategy, there is no point of exploratory action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Nota bene: Game theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game theory is a mathematical framework to handle adversarial interactions
 as in the sketched soccer scenario.
 It summarizes the outcome of actions into a so called game matrix that
 is shown below.
 Here, the values indicate the reward 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 of the captain 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 over the goalkeeper 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 for jumping left 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 or right 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathcal{R} & c_{L} & c_{R}\\
g_{L} & 0 & 1\\
g_{R} & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if either party where to commit to a strategy (say 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

), the other party could adjust to that by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 likewise.
 That way, the captain would maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

, while the goalkeeper would minimize it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of a Nash equilibrium provides a solution to this dilemma: 
\series bold
Both agents should adopt a strategy that will have either party be off worse
 if they depart from it.

\series default
 This is the case for the following probabilities of acting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathcal{R} & c_{L}@.5 & c_{R}@.5\\
g_{L}@.5 & 0 & 1\\
g_{R}@.5 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where does this fit in the language of reinforcment learning above? The
 game-theoretic scenario assumes both the gatekeeper and environment to
 respond optimally, i.e., a stubborn goalkeeper is not considered.
 Then, we let the parties interact and come up with the most complicated
 schedules 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \pi_{t}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and learning schemes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

 they can imagine.
 Ultimately, 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle\mathcal{R}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} ,\,\mathcal{E}\left(\left\{ a_{t}\right\} \right)\right)\rangle_{a_{t}\sim\pi_{t},\mathcal{E},t}$
\end_inset

 will be bounded from above by 
\begin_inset Formula $.5$
\end_inset

, which is the best average score the captain can achieve (or the smallest
 loss the goalkeeper can try to prevent) in every trial.
