title: What is meta in meta-learning?
subtitle: Meta-learning is a term that has paramount usage. What gives rise to its usefulness, and how does it relate to transfer learning, and learning in general?

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Meta-learning summarizes the concept of learning a more general framework to learn â€“ hence the name. Yet, this concept subsumizes a range of multiple concepts, including transfer learning, few-shot learning, continual learning, and fine-tuning. We develop an abstracted framework that unifies these notions. This extends beyond parametric models.
