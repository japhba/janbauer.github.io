I am a PhD student in [Jonathan Kadmon's group](https://neuro-theory.org/research) at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences at Hebrew University, Jerusalem. We are fascinated by the **vast generalization properties that enable biological agents to adapt to a variety of tasks**. Is the rich structure of the brain a skillfully crafted toolbox to cope with a multifaceted world, or are its compartments essentially a [hysteresis artifact]() of evolution? 

To tackle this question, we incorporate such [symmetry breaking]() into machine learning models and compare learning to experiment. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08340" >}}mutual insights{{< /staticref >}} that the fields of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence have enjoyed throughout their history.
